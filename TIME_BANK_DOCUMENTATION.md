- **Withdrawals**: Redemption of credits for rewards
- **Interest**: Additional value generated through reuse and collaboration
- **Investment**: Credits used for further automation development

### 2. Value Creation Chain
```
Automation Creation → Time Saved → Credits Earned → Rewards Redeemed → Increased Motivation → More Automations
```

### 3. Stakeholder Benefits

## Calculations and Formulas

### Core Financial Calculations

#### Hourly Value Calculation
```
Time Value = Department Hourly Rate × Quality Multiplier × Innovation Factor
Quality Multiplier = 0.85 (15% reduction for errors/maintenance)
Innovation Factor = 1.0 to 1.5 (based on automation complexity)
```

#### Development Cost Estimation
```
Development Cost = Development Hours × Developer Hourly Rate
Average Development Hours = 8 hours per automation
Developer Hourly Rate = $120/hour
Total Development Investment = Number of Automations × Average Cost
```

#### Payback Period
```
Monthly Savings = (Time Saved Hours / Month) × Hourly Rate × Quality Multiplier
Payback Months = Development Cost / Monthly Savings
```

### Credit System Calculations

#### Credit Earning Rate
```
Credits per Minute Saved = 1 credit
Bonus Multipliers:
- Cross-department: +15%
- Innovation category: +20%
- High complexity: +10% to +50%
- Reusability: +25%
```

#### Credit Value Conversion
```
Credit Dollar Value = Average Hourly Rate / 60 minutes
Average Hourly Rate = Σ(Department Rates) / Number of Departments
Current Rate = ~$81.43/hour or ~$1.36 per credit
```

#### Credit Velocity Metrics
```
Utilization Rate = Credits Spent / Credits Earned × 100
Velocity Score = Credits Earned / Credits Spent (circulation rate)
Participation Rate = Active Users / Total Users × 100
```

### Business Impact Calculations

#### Innovation Value
```
Innovation Time = Total Time Saved × 30% (assumption: 30% goes to innovation)
Innovation Dollar Value = Innovation Time × Innovation Rate ($150/hour)
Strategic Value = Innovation Value + Employee Satisfaction Value
```

#### Quality Impact
```
Error Reduction Value = Time Saved × Error Rate Improvement × Rework Cost
Compliance Value = Audit Cost Savings + Risk Mitigation Value
Total Quality Value = Error Reduction + Compliance + Standardization Benefits
```

#### Future Projections
```
Growth Rate = 15% monthly automation increase (historical trend)
Annual Savings Projection = Current Savings × 12 × (1 + Growth Rate)
Pipeline Value = Pending Automations × Average Development Cost
```
